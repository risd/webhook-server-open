### What the server does

The Webhook Server runs several workers and web servers that are used in conjuction with the webhook-cms and webhook tools to generate static sites.

The workers handle things such as: Generating static sites on demand, uploading static sites to cloud storage, inviting users to work on sites, backing up data periodically, etc.

The web server handles things such as: Uploading images, searching using elastic search, and uploading sites to the workers.
